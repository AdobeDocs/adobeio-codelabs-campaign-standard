# Adobe I/O CodeLabs template

## Getting started 

Click on the "Use this template" button to copy the template to your namespace. 

The codelab entry point is the [README](README.md). You can put your codelab content including assets under the [lessons](/lessons) directory. The codelab [manifest.json](manifest.json) holds the navigation information and more. Link your lessons in that file in order to render the navigation.

## Preview codelab locally

The template codelab is based on the Project Helix https://www.project-helix.io/. Follow instructions as explained.

`npm i -g @adobe/helix-cli && hlx up` is enough to get you started. Make sure to have at least `npm@6.14.x` installed and an initial commit. 

## Share codelab URL

You can visit https://[REPO_NAME]-[REPO_OWNER].project-helix.page to see it running.

Demo: https://adobeio-codelabs-template-adobedocs.project-helix.page/ 

Make sure to push your changes before sharing the URL.
