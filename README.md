# Build a Firefly App for Customer Profiles using Adobe Campaign Standard API

## Summary

[Project Firefly](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/project-firefly) is a complete framework that enables enterprise developers to build and deploy custom web applications that extend Adobe Experience Cloud solutions and run on Adobe infrastructure. It leverages modern technologies (JAM stack, serverless computing, Node, and React) and ensures best practices when building applications (event-driven architecture, microservices, continuous integration, and delivery).  

[Adobe Campaign Standard (ACS)](https://www.adobe.com/marketing/campaign.html) provides a platform for designing and executing digital marketing campaigns and provides an environment for visual campaign orchestration.  

[Campaign Standard APIs](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/campaign-standard/using/working-with-apis/about-campaign-standard-apis/about-campaign-standard-apis.html) are aimed at letting you create integrations for Adobe Campaign Standard and build your own ecosystem by interfacing Adobe Campaign Standard with the panel of technologies that you use.

In this lab, you will learn how to build a simple web app listing customer profiles and allowing personalized email promotions through ACS API.

## Prerequisites

This codelab is for anyone who are getting started with developing Firefly apps. There are a few prerequisites to get you started.
